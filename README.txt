Installation
Extract the zip file to a folder of your choosing.
Make a new project and import the src folder.
Add to the build path the libraries in the lib folder.
Don't mind the JavaFX errors, they are only present in Eclipse and not in IntelliJ.


Testing
The JUnit tests are present in the test folder.


Starting the game
Open a terminal at the folder of installation
Type "java -jar Connect4.jar [tui] [gui]"
tui for the Textual User Interface, gui for the Graphical User Interface
If you can't start the gui please use a different laptop/desktop, we couldn't get it to work with 1 computer ourselves. (Something with pipeline initialization error)
